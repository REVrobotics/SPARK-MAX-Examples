# Velocity Closed Loop Control

### Description
This example shows how to use a PID closed loop controller to set the velocity of a motor to a specified number of revolutions per minute. For demonstration, the velocity setpoint will be dependent on the joystick's y-axis value.

### Usage
Set the variables at the beginning of the example to match your setup.
- `deviceID` - CAN device ID

Control the motor's velocity by moving the joystick up or down.

The setpoint and process variable will be displayed on SmartDashboard.
